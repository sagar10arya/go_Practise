/*
--When we want to convert a Golang struct into a JSON object, we use the json.Marshal.
Marshal is Golangs way of saying "encode/convert to JSON Object"
-- As with all structs in Go, itâ€™s important to remember that only fields with a capital first letter
are visible to external programs/packages like the JSON Marshaller.
-- func Marshal(v interface{}) ([]byte, error)
	it takes a v interface{}, which can be 'any' go type. Basically everything from a struct to a
	primitive it iwll take it and try to convert it to a JSON object. It returns two things.
		1. a slice of byte []byte, containing the literal string that is the JSON object.
		2. And error, letting you know if anything went wrong
